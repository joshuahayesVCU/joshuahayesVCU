**Thank you for checking out my GitHub!**

My name is Joshua Hayes, I am a 4th year CS major at Virginia Commonwealth University. I am currently working as a part-time backend software engineer at Markel Group while I finish my degree. I received this position after stellar performance as an intern. 

At Markel, I work on a .NET BAU team as a backend engineer and participate in the agile process. 

My current focus is my senior capstone project. I am leading a team of 5 multi-disciplined engineers (CS and EE) in an effort to centralize the knowledge base of a young but successful research project. You can view our efforts at [LittleRamPantry.com](http://littlerampantries.com). Unfortunately, the code is closed source - but you can view my front-end code in the repo [LRP_Frontend](https://github.com/joshuahayesVCU/LRP_Frontend)

Throughout my Github you'll find school projects such as CMSC508-final. Personal side projects like realFakeNews, Odin-LandingPage, odin-RockPaperScissors, and ClimbingApi. And projects that I followed a tutorial such as IssuesApi and TodoApi. You'll also find my dotfiles, I enjoy doing development in a terminal environment with Neovim.
