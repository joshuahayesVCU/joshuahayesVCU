# Welcome to My GitHub!

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Joshua Hayes, a 4th-year Computer Science major at Virginia Commonwealth University. Currently, I'm balancing my academic journey with real-world experience as a part-time backend software engineer at Markel Group, where I contribute to a .NET BAU team as a full-stack engineer, actively engaging in the agile development process.

## Professional Experience

I earned my position at Markel Group based on outstanding performance during my internship. As part of the team, I tackle various responsibilities, contributing to the continuous improvement of the software.

## Senior Capstone Project - Little Ram Pantries

My main focus is on my senior capstone project. Leading a team of 5 multi-disciplined engineers (CS and EE), we aim to centralize the knowledge base of the successful research project [LittleRamPantry.com](http://littlerampantries.com). While the code is closed source, you can explore my front-end contributions in the [LRP_Frontend](https://github.com/joshuahayesVCU/LRP_Frontend) repository.
